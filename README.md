## Introduction
In this project, I explored news articles from Politico and Power Line from October 2013 to February 2020. I accomplished this by creating word clouds, performing PCA, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.


## Data
The data comes from newzy dataset and can be found here: https://virginia.app.box.com/s/bj8f1khrkfd6thm9umq35m6xp2an4zej/file/624341579635

## Description of Files

- analysis_anoop_nath.ipynb - This is the jupyter notebook that was used to run all the text analytics. The code was initially created in Google Colab. Some visualizations did not transfer over from colab to GitHub, threfore it is ideal to view the code directly from colab.
